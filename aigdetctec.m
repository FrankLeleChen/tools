% Sensory discrimination is typically analyzed through signal detection
% theory
% "Hits":        P(Yes|Signal)
% "Miss":        P(No|Signal)
% "False Alarms": P(Yes|Noise)
% "Correct Reject": P(No|Noise)

% In texture discrimination task, the "texture" condition is the signal and
% the "no texture" condition the noise.
% "Hits" (correct detection) are trials where the mouse samples the panel and
% then goes to the correct reward port
% "False Alarms" are trials when the mouse samples the panel and then goes
% to the wrong reward port
